# Trophies Bot
Trophies Bot is a bot that can be used to award trophies to users. You can create your own trophies per server with a custom name, description, image and even value, and assign them to users by doing stuff you think deserves to be awarded.
You can then give reward roles for reaching certain scores, or having a leaderboard for the user scores.

To get started, simply type `/help` in your server to see a few basic info.
