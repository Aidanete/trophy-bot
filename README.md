# Trophies Bot
Trophies Bot is a bot that can be used to award trophies to users. You can create your own trophies per server with a custom name, description, image and even value, and assign them to users by doing stuff you think deserves to be awarded.
You can then give reward roles for reaching certain scores, or having a leaderboard for the trophies.

To get started, simply type `trophy tutorial` in your server. You can see all commands with `trophy help`.
